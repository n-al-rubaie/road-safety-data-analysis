## Overview
The dataset contains **117,536 records** of accidents, including location, time, vehicles involved, severity, and environmental conditions. The project investigates patterns in:

- Speed vs. accident occurrence  
- Weather and lighting conditions  
- Accident severity across different scenarios  

---

## Methodology
- **Pre-processing:** Cleaned and recoded data in Excel (weather, lighting, road, and junction conditions)  
- **Analysis:** Used **K-Means Clustering** in Python to identify patterns and trends  
- **Visualisation:** Bar charts, scatter plots, and cluster diagrams to explore accident factors  

---

## Key Findings
- Most accidents occurred on **20mph roads**, not higher-speed roads  
- Accidents were frequent in **fine and rainy conditions**, fewer in snow/fog  
- More accidents occurred during **daylight** than in darkness, though night accidents still present  

**Insight:** Driver education and targeted road safety measures can reduce accidents in high-risk areas and conditions
